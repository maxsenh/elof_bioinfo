# By now you should know what "FirstResidue" means. Anyway, fix this to ground:

# Let MMB do the alignment for you with SeqAn. Note we are NOT specifying noGap.  That means we ALLOW gaps in our alignment.

# In this case let's use collision detecting spheres to prevent steric clashes. In a prior exercise we used MD forces, and you are welcome to try that here as well.
