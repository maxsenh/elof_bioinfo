# This is an example of how to use constrainInterfaces to do comparative modeling.
# It is a bit trivial, in that we are bringing chain A in to replace chain C. But chain A and chain C are actually identical.  But this should give you the idea.

# Make sure these PDB files are in the current directory, of course:
loadSequencesFromPdb 1FC2.pdb
# This contains a chain C which has been renamed "A".  chain D is deleted:

# Just for illustration, we start with the new chain (A) displaced away from the Fc (D):
initialDisplacement A 10 0 0
# Now we pull A onto C:
alignmentForces A C
#gappedThreading A C
# While keeping C (original SpA) on Fc (D):
constrainInterfaces .6  
# This command detects any clashes. Note A and C clash later in the stage!  This is expected, and is not a problem, particularly since physics is turned off.
