# Before you begin, you should issue something like :
# cp ../examples/1ARJ.short.pdb ./last.1.pdb

# Instantiate the RNA :
RNA  N 17       GGCAGAUCUGAGCCUGGGAGCUCUCUGCC

# Alternatively, we could have gotten the sequence and residue numbering from the input PDB file, with:
# loadSequencesFromPdb

# We don't want to move the system center of mass to the global origin in this case, nor do we want to enforce zero overall momenta. So set:
removeRigidBodyMomentum False

constrainToGround N 17

# Specify rigid segments:
mobilizer Rigid       N 17 21
mobilizer Rigid       N 27 38
mobilizer Rigid       N 41 45

# To prevent the discontinuous domain from splitting:
constraint      N 17 Weld  N 45

#constraintTolerance .001

# Collision-detecting spheres will prevent some steric clashes, at very low computational cost:
contact SelectedAtoms N FirstResidue LastResidue
# An alternative to this is the AllHeavyAtomSterics scheme, which puts collision-detecting spheres on all atoms except Hydrogen:
# contact AllHeavyAtomSterics N FirstResidue LastResidue
# Another (much more expensive) alternative is to turn on the MD force field. However note that in the absence of counterions, the domains will try to spread apart:
# setDefaultMDParameters
