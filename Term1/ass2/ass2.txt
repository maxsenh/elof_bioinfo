1. What is the difference between blastn and blastp?

blastn - database of nucleotide sequences
blastp - database of protein sequences

2. Which blastall flag would you use to specify the blast program (e.g. blastp)?

blastall -p

3. What does the e-value stand for and which e-values are better and which are worse?

e-value - Except value
Its the value describing the number of hits by chance one can expect by searching a specific database. Since it is exponentially decreasing as the match increases, the lower E-value one has the better.

4. What is the best hit you obtain? You can just copy paste the line from the Blast output.

UniRef90_P19174 1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphod...  2580   

5. How many hits did you find at e-values less than or equal to 10?

28167

6. Name one advantage and one disadvantage when using dotplots to detect evolutionary relationships between sequences.

advantage: it finds the best possible alignment between two sequences
disadvantage: it only shows 100% matches between (similar) amino acids

7. What is the alignment corresponding to the path illustrated in the following dotplot?

B I O I N F A B O O K
| |         | |     |
B I N D S - A B A N K

8. What is the Hamming distance between the sequences TGGGC and TAGGC?

1

9. What kind of information does a BLOSUM matrix describe?

It describes the score for an alignment between evolutionarily divergent protein sequences.

10. Why do you think it is necessary to use  substitution matrices when scoring an alignment?

One can use it to find the score between two amino acids in two sequence

11. Using a BLOSUM matrix, which subsitution is more probable: F<->Y or H<->R?

F <-> Y     score 3     more probalbe, since 3 is higher than 0
H <-> R     score 0

12. What are the total substitution scores of the alignments? (Hint: sum the scores from the BLOSUM62 matrix)
                                13. gap penalty
X1G: VMMMVIH--F     total: 28       A. -4   B. -5
Y1G: VM--VIHWHY

X2G: VMMMVIHF--     total: 22       B. -21  B. -21,5
Y2G: ---MVIHWHY

13. A. I calculated -1 for every gap opening and added -1 more for each gap which was added
    B. I calculated -10 for every gap opening and added -0,5 more for each gap which was added
